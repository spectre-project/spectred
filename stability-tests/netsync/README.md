# Netsync Stability Tester

This tests that the netsync is at least 5 blocks per second.

Note: the test doesn't delete spectred's data directory and it's the
user responsibility to delete the data directories that appear in the
log.

## Running

1. `go install spectred`
2. `go install ./...`
3. `cd run`
4. `./run.sh`
