# spectrectl

`spectrectl` is an RPC client for `spectred`.

## Requirements

Go 1.23 or later.

## Build from Source

* Install Go according to the installation instructions here:
  http://golang.org/doc/install

* Ensure Go was installed properly and is a supported version:

```bash
go version
```

* Run the following commands to obtain and install `spectred`
  including all dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spectre-project/spectred
cd spectred/cmd/spectrectl
go install .
```

* `spectrectl` should now be installed in `$(go env GOPATH)/bin`. If
  you did not already add the bin directory to your system path
  during Go installation, you are encouraged to do so now.

## Usage

The full `spectrectl` configuration options can be seen with:

```bash
spectrectl --help
```

But the minimum configuration needed to run it is:

```bash
spectrectl <REQUEST_JSON>
```

For example:

```
spectrectl '{"getBlockDagInfoRequest":{}}'
```

For a list of all available requests check out the [RPC documentation](infrastructure/network/netadapter/server/grpcserver/protowire/rpc.md)
