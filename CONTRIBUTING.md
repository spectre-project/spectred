# Contributing to Spectred

Any contribution to Spectred is very welcome.

## Getting started

If you want to start contributing to Spectred and don't know where to
start, you can pick an issue from the [list](https://github.com/spectre-project/spectred/issues).

If you want to make a big change it's better to discuss it first by
opening an issue or talk about it in development [Discord](https://discord.spectre-network.org/)
to avoid duplicate work.

## Pull Request process

Any pull request should be opened against the development branch
`dev`.

All pull requests should pass the checks written in
`build_and_test.sh`, so it's recommended to run this script before
submitting your PR.
