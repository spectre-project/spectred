Package txscript implements the spectre transaction script language.
There is a comprehensive test suite.

## Spectre Scripts

Spectre provides a stack-based, FORTH-like language for the scripts in
the spectre transactions. This language is not turing complete although
it is still fairly powerful.

## Examples

* [Standard Pay-to-pubkey Script](http://godoc.org/github.com/spectre-project/spectred/txscript#example-PayToAddrScript)  
  Demonstrates creating a script which pays to a spectre address. It
  also prints the created script hex and uses the DisasmString
  function to display the disassembled script.

* [Extracting Details from Standard Scripts](http://godoc.org/github.com/spectre-project/spectred/txscript#example-ExtractPkScriptAddrs)  
  Demonstrates extracting information from a standard public key
  script.
